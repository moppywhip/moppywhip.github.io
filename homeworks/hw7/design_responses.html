							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The Gestalt principles are a group of visual perception principles developed by German psychologists in the 1920s. They are based on the idea that "an organized whole is perceived as greater than the sum of its parts." The principles are used in UI design to help create effective visual communication and improve user experience. For example, the proximity principle can be used in UI design to group similar information and organize content, and the common region principle can be used to create visual hierarchies and guide the user's attention. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> What stood out to me in this article is the discussion of the four key ideas behind the Gestalt principles: emergence, reification, multi-stability, and invariance. These ideas provide insight into how our brains process visual information, and how this can be used in UI design to create effective visual communication and improve user experience. For example, the principle of emergence states that people tend to identify elements first in their general outlined form, and this can be used in UI design to create simple, well-defined objects that are easy for users to recognize and understand. </p>
