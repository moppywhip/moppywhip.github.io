                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> This article contained a lot of examples of interesting UI interactions. However, I find myself disagreeing
                                with some of the design choices here. For example, for the search bar, upon eliminating possibilities, I find the explosion animation too "extra" for daily practical use.

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> This article didn't contain much text so my favorite part would be the variety of different UI designs being showcased.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration has got to be the loading bar. I think oftentimes developers
                                don't pay enough attention to this component of UI design. The loading bar is something that is often viewed and used so making it look
                            exciting or aesthetically please while being informative is a big plus to me. The design achieves this with a pulsating icon as well as a dynamic loading bar 
                        that iterates through the process. </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 8. I liked looking at a lot of these designs, even though some of them seemed kind of extra.  </p>
