						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Dark patterns are user interfaces that have been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things they don't want to do, such as buying insurance with their purchase or signing up for recurring bills. The term was coined in 2010 by UX designer Harry Brignull, and has been used in a variety of contexts. Dark patterns are often created with a solid understanding of human psychology, and do not have the user's best interests in mind. They can have serious consequences, such as class-action lawsuits and loss of trust from users. Designers should strive to create transparent and user-friendly interfaces rather than using dark patterns to manipulate users.</p>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> One interesting aspect of this article is the discussion of the different types of dark patterns. These include forced continuity, in which users are automatically signed up for recurring payments or subscriptions without their knowledge or consent; bait and switch, in which users are lured in with a low-price offer that is later changed or hidden; and disguised ads, in which ads are presented as part of the user interface, making it difficult for users to distinguish between content and advertising. Understanding these different types of dark patterns can help designers avoid using them in their own work, and can help users recognize and avoid them when they encounter them. </p>
